    <p>Digital fashion makes everything traditional
      fashion does—shirts, dresses, pants, hats, shoes,
      and accessories—but none of it is tangible.
      Instead, customers “wear” digital clothing through
      augmented reality and digitally altered photos. </p>

    <p class="breakleft">As COVID-era Fashion Shows Go Virtual, New Opportunities for Designers Emerge</p>
    <br>
    <p>Words by Ritupriya Basu</p>

  <div id="paragraph1">
    <p class="break">In June, as London Fashion Week stepped into the virtual realm, designer Natasha Zinko and her 13-year-old son Ivan decided to launch their Spring 2021 collection through a photoshoot set alternately in a poppy field outside Odessa, Ukraine, and an atmospheric nightclub. Images from the shoot were released on Instagram alongside a set of three 3D renders created by digital artist duo Pussykrew in collaboration with the boutique The Webster, where the collection will arrive early next year. In the renders, models wearing poppy-print minidresses and pinstripe suits from the Natasha Zinko X DUOLtd collection strike a pose next to sprays of tropical blooms, and hover over pools of glistening, iridescent liquid.</p>

  <div id="paragraph2">
      <p class="breakleft"">The rich, retro tone of the clothing is offset by the futuristic landscapes they’re placed in.</p>

      <p>“We’ve noticed many artists trying to imitate the real world in the digital medium,” says Pussykrew, “but we’re all about embracing the unknown, adapting and inventing new realms, and looking for possible futures. We like to bring to life sensorial and visual combinations that we haven’t seen before, but always wanted to see, rather than recreating the world as we know it.”</p>

      <p>With an increase in virtual fashion shows comes more opportunities for cross-industry collaborations. For digital designers, Dizon has a quick tip:</p>

      <p>“I would recommend that any designer interested in exploring work within the fashion industry needs to do their homework on the different fashion brands, photographers, stylists, and other creatives. As we all know, there are many different aesthetic cliques at work and it’s about finding teams of people with whom you can contribute something fresh and sophisticated.”</p>

      <p>These immersive technologies are helping not only to democratize the format, but are also allowing brands to push the conversation much beyond the aesthetics and the clothes to ideas and issues closer to a label’s heart. “My hope is that more people will take risks and use the fantastical possibilities of digital media,” says Engman. “For Collina Strada, for example, the digital aspect allowed us to work with disabled artists and activists like Emily Barker and Aaron Philip in ways that would have been logistically difficult for us without the use of digital media. But the possibility of inclusion and reformatting has always been present regardless of technology; it’s the will to prioritize inclusion and change that is most important.”</p>
